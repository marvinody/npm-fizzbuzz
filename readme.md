# Dumb Fizzbuzz

```javascript
For(
  one(),
  lessThan(16),
  plusplus(),
  If(divisibleBy(15))
    .Then(say("fizzbuzz"))
    .Elif(divisibleBy(3))
    .Then(say("fizz"))
    .Elif(divisibleBy(5))
    .Then(say("buzz"))
    .Else(sayNumber())
)();
```

A beauty, isn't it?

I remember seeing a meme like thing except where they important all of those packages and used it to shame the state of npm.

I'm not making a statement, I just wanted to replicate it with my own code
